# Golden_Jackals_WGS
Scripts developed for the manuscript "Unravelling the golden jackal's genomic journey: insights into their origin, expansion, and hybridisation across Eurasia from whole-genome data". It includes all the code needed to reproduce the plots in the manuscript.

These scripts were developed by Nuno Martins, any questions and issues can be directed to:

All computational tasks were scheduled and executed via a Slurm system, ensuring efficient resource allocation and parallel execution on an HPC cluster.
